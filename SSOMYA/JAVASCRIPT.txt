7 data types - undefined - variable not defined.
               null -  variable value is null.
               boolean - true/false
               string - series of character,in double quotes or single quotes
               symbol - immutable primitive value that is unique.
               number
               object - store diff. key value pairs.

var *name* = *set value to any of the data types above*
can change value/data type anywhere 

let *name* = *value*

const pi = 3.14 - cant change value now

you can skip semi colons , but its recommended.

a=7;
console.log(a); - shows value of a in console

var c= "hello";
c=c+"world"; - shows combined output

variables are case sensitive

a+=9 --> a=a+9

put '\'(escape sequences) before " to not identify it as a end of string but only a character OR you can start your string with single quote.

back ticks (`) can also be used to define a string and hence both " and ' can be used.

var str= "hello"+"louis";

var str="may";
console.log("my name is"+str);

*string name*.length() - gives the length in int

separate characters of string - *str name*[i] , i=1 to length-1

STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE . CHARACTERS CANT BE CHNAGED SEPARATELY. type a whole new string.

function *name*( variable arguments )
{
}
call normally with *function name*()

spaces - " "

You can use any data type in your array var a=["john",23,43.87] 

arrays are mutable.

*array name*.push( *element* ) - add element in array AT THE END. (SS)

*array name*.push() - remove last element in the array.

*array name*.shift() - remove first element in the array.
*array name*.unshift( *element* ) - add at first place in the array.

console.log(a-b); - direct operation

outside func. variable has global scope

if inside a function , you dont put "var" before a variable name then it would AUTOMATICALLY BECOME GLOBAL VARIABLE(not possible in scrimba), else remain local only.
OR you can declare it outside any function using var.

when there is local and global variable with the same name , then LOCAL variable TAKES HIGHER PRIORITY.

in Queue , items are kept in order. new items added at the back (right side) and old items removed from front (left side).

JSON.stringify(*array name*) - print array as a string

no qoutation marks around boolean true & false.

strict equality operator ( === ) doesnt chnage the data type ( 3 === 3 - TRUE ) ( 3 === '3' - FALSE)
with == both would have been TRUE

strict inequality operator - !== no type conversions

if , else if , else
